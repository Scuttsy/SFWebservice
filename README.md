# Subtle Feedback Webservice

This is a RESTful API made as part of a larger study focused on understanding the efficacy of subtle implementations of player feedback on player learning and performance in a third person action combat game.

This study was conductedd as part of my graduation work for my Bachelors Program at the Howest University of Applied Sciences for Digital Arts and Entertainment, majoring in Independent Game Production.

## Caution
This API is intended to be connected to a deployed SQL Server, in order for the API to properly function the connection string will need to be exchanged with a valid connection to a deployed database.
